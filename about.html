                        The Blockchain Disintegration technique is used to lock and therefore<br>
                        secure a block chain from intrusion by unauthorized personnel.<br><br>
                        This is achieved by removing a certain number of random blocks from the<br>
                        blockchain and storing them in variables when the option “LOCK” is selected.<br>
                        On selecting the “UNLOCK” option, The deleted blocks are inserted in the original positions.<br><br>
                        The details of the deleted blocks are neither known to the users nor the administrator. <br>
                        It is only known to the system.
